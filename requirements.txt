# Pin to NumPy 1.x because TensorFlow/macOS wheels and keras-facenet currently
# link against 1.x; NumPy 2.x breaks those binaries on import.

# TensorFlow (use tensorflow-macos on Apple Silicon; see README)
# 2.15.x remains compatible with NumPy 1.26.x and works on Python 3.10/3.11.
# On Intel macOS use `tensorflow==2.15.0`; on Apple Silicon prefer
# `tensorflow-macos==2.15.0` and optionally `tensorflow-metal` for acceleration.
